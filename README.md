# Coding-Quiz-App 2.0
This is my second attempt at coding a quiz application following my graduation from University of Birmigham Front-end Web Development and UX Design Bootcamp.

I have been able to build multiple functionalities into this particular version after much practice.

Here is a [link](https://contentcommando.github.io/Coding-Quiz-2/) to the application.

## App Functionalities

1. **Timer**: The quiz timer is set to a maximum of 40 seconds. At the click of the start button, the timer starts reading and the first quiz is available on the screen.

2. **Multiple-Choice Questions**: Each question set contains four options for answer with clickable tabs. Upon clicking on any of these buttons, the user immediately sees whether their selected option is rigth or wrong. There are a total five questions. Each carries 20 marks. User therefore can score up to a total of 100 marks or 100%.

3. **Penalty**: The penalty for selecting a wrong answer is a 10-second reduction in time.

4. **Reward**: The reward for scoring a total of 60% or above is that the user can save their name to a leaderboard, and the record becomes persistent data, because local storage is used for this project.

5. **Highscores Records**: When the game ends, it displays the user's score. Previous highscores can be viewed.

6. **Time-out**: If time runs out before all questions are answered, the quiz closes.

7. **Sound effects**: Sound effects have been embedded into the code to notify the user if their answer is wrong or right. Also makes the quiz more fun!!!.


## Difficulties
The most challenging part of this project was having to tie "a score and name input" together and set/get them to/from local storage.

I deployed my debugging techiques in resolving some problems around "Timer" conditional statements which was causing propagation effects.


## Future work

This will be to add more questions to the application and make it cover a wider area of web development topics and sub-topics.

I also will like to make the codebase more "DRY".
